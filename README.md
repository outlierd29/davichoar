 I'm a machine learning engineer passionate about making apps and APIs with an AI backend. Also, I love NLP topics and cloud stuff (specially AWS and GCP). I'm very curious about different architectures for AI solutions and good MLOps frameworks.

I've been working on Data Science and Machine Learning since 2018, and never stopped since then. I have a strong background in software engineering, as well as statistics and data engineering.

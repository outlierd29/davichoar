 I'm a machine learning engineer from Peru, passionate about making apps with ML components. Also, I love NLP topics and cloud stuff (specially AWS and GCP). I'm very curious about different architectures for AI solutions and nice MLOps frameworks.

I've been working on Data Science and Machine Learning since 2018, and never stopped since then. I have a strong background in software engineering, as well as statistics and data engineering.


- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Python, Machine Learning, GenAI, Serverless, MLOps, APIs and Data Pipelines.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to send me an email to outlierd@pm.me or connect via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dascencr/_).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects for ML platforms / frameworks (such as Kubeflow, Langchain) in Python.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love manga/anime and playing basketball. My favorite anime is Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, and my favorite team is the Miami Heat!
